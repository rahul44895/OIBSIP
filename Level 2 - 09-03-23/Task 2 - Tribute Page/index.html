                Here you'll get to know about my life history and my inventions.<br>
                I was a Serbian American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for
                my contributions to the design of the modern alternating current electricity supply system.

                        that Tesla invented the radio years previous to Marconi.</div>

                Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla developed the alternating-current electrical system that's widely
                used today, and discovered the rotating magnetic field - the basis of most AC machinery.

">Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla was born in July of 1856, in what is now Croatia. He came to the United States
                in 1884, and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several patent
                rights, including those to his alternating-current machinery, to George Westinghouse. His 1891
                invention, the "Tesla coil," is still used in radio technology today. Tesla died in New York City on
                January 7, 1943.

">Tesla came to the United States in 1884, and soon began working with famed inventor and business mogul Thomas Edison.
                The two worked together for a brief period before parting ways due to a conflicting business-scientific
                relationship, attributed by historians to their incredibly different personalities: While Edison was a
                power figure who focused on marketing and financial success, Tesla was a commercially out-of-tune and
                somewhat vulnerable, yet extremely pivotal inventor, who pioneered some of history's most important
                inventions. His inventions include the "Tesla coil," developed in 1891, and an alternating-current
                electrical system of generators, motors and transformers—both of which are still used widely today.
